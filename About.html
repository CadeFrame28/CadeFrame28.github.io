        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am planning to graduate in May of 2024 with a bachelors degree in Managenement Information Systems. I recently worked at Consolidated Electrical Distributors, located in Irving, as a software developer. I played a couple of sports in high school, and always love to work with teams.In high school, I worked at Blue Goose Cantina for about 3 and a half years as a foodrunner, busser, and expo. I am a leader who knows how to get the job done, and I am determined to get better each and every single day.</p>
